    <h5>Browned butter cornbread baked in a cast iron corn pone pan.</h5>
<p>Not too sweet, not too savoury, but warm, rich, nutty cornbread goodness. Adapted from Binging with Babish.</p>
<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>8 Tbsp butter, melted</li>
        <br>

        <li>5 oz of finely ground cornmeal</li>
        <li>5 oz of all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>  ½ tsp of baking powder</li>
        <li>  ½ tsp of baking soda</li>
        <li> 1 tsp of kosher salt</li>
        <li> 3 tbsp of sugar </li>
        <br>
        
        <li>1 ½ cups of buttermilk</li>
        <li> 2 large eggs</li>
        <br>
        
        <li> Sea Salt</li>
        <li> Honey</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
        <p><ol>

        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine 5 ounces of finely ground cornmeal and 5 ounces of all-purpose flour. Add ½ a teaspoon of baking powder, ½ a teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 3 tablespoons of sugar. Whisk together accordingly. </li>
        <li>In a separate mixing bowl, whisk 2 large eggs and 1 ½ cups of buttermilk together. </li>
        <li>Melt 1 stick of butter in a cast iron skillet over medium heat while swirling constantly to prevent it from overheating and exploding. Swirl until the milk fats separate and begin to turn brown. </li>
        <li>Pour the butter into a heat-proof container and add 2 ice cubes to allow it to cool down rapidly. Give it a little mix for 1 to 2 minutes or until the ice cubes are fully melted. </li>
        <li>Combine the butter with the egg and buttermilk mixture and then pour to combine with your dry ingredients. Gently paddle to combine until you end up with a pancake batter consistency. </li>
        <li>Using the same cast iron skillet that is still lubed up with about 1 tablespoon of the brown butter, add the cornbread batter and smooth it out on the top. Place the skillet into a 425°F oven for 20 to 25 minutes until deep golden brown around the edges.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the cornbread is cooked by using a toothpick and making sure that there are only a few moist crumbs remaining on the toothpick. After allowing the cornbread to cool in the skillet for about 5 to 10 minutes, give it a drizzle of honey and brush it on for even coverage to create a shiny and sticky glaze. Then, give it a sprinkling of flaky sea salt. </li>
        <li>Carefully remove the cornbread from the skillet and allow it to cool on a wire rack for about 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving while it is still warm.</li>
